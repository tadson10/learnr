## Topic 1

### Exercise without JOBE server

*Here's a simple exercise with an empty code chunk provided for entering the answer.*

Write the Javascript function to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number:

```{js simpleJS, exercise=TRUE,  exercise.timelimit = 2, exercise.eval=TRUE, exercise.cap = "app.js", exercise.id="firstJSExercise", exercise.type = "js"}

```   

## Topic 2

### Exercise with JOBE server

*Here's a simple exercise with some prepopulated code. To specify the PORT on which server should run, use process.env.PORT. Otherwise there could be problems while trying to run server.*

Now write simple Express server:

```{js express1,exercise=TRUE, exercise.id = "expressExercise", exercise.timelimit = 30, exercise.type = "js", exercise.lines = 50, exercise.cap = "app.js", exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.serverIP = "111.111.111.111"}  
const express = require('express'); 
const app = express(); 

app.listen(process.env.PORT, () => console.log(`This app is listening on port `  + process.env.PORT));
``` 

```{r express2,exercise=TRUE, exercise.id = "expressExercise", exercise.type = "js", exercise.lines = 50, exercise.cap = "index.html", exercise.serverIP = "111.111.111.111"} 
 
```

```{r express3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.id = "expressExercise", exercise.type = "js", exercise.lines = 50, exercise.cap = "styles.css", exercise.serverIP = "111.111.111.111"} 
 
```

```{js express4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.id = "expressExercise", exercise.type = "js", exercise.timelimit = 10, exercise.lines = 50, exercise.cap = "script.js", exercise.serverIP = "111.111.111.111"} 
function yourFunction() {
	console.log("called yourFunction");
}       
``` 

## Topic 3

### Exercise - R

*Here's a simple exercise with an empty code chunk provided for entering the answer.*

Write the R code required to add two plus two:

```{r two-plus-two, exercise=TRUE}

```

### Exercise with Code - R

*Here's an exercise with some prepopulated code as well as `exercise.lines = 5` to provide a bit more initial room to work.*

Now write a function that adds any two numbers and then call it:

```{r add-function, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
add <- function() {
  
}
```

## Topic 4

### Exercise with Hint

*Here's an exercise where the chunk is pre-evaulated via the `exercise.eval` option (so the user can see the default output we'd like them to customize). We also add a "hint" to the correct solution via the chunk immediate below labeled `print-limit-hint`.*

Modify the following code to limit the number of rows printed to 5:

```{r print-limit, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
mtcars
```

```{r print-limit-hint}
head(mtcars)
```

### Quiz

*You can include any number of single or multiple choice questions as a quiz. Use the `question` function to define a question and the `quiz` function for grouping multiple questions together.*

Some questions to verify that you understand the purposes of various base and recommended R packages:

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question("Which package contains functions for installing other R packages?",
    answer("base"),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("utils", correct = TRUE),
    answer("codetools")
  ),
  question("Which of the R packages listed below are used to create plots?",
    answer("lattice", correct = TRUE),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("stats"),
    answer("grid", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```
